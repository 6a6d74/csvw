        Tabular data is routinely transferred on the web as "CSV", but the definition of "CSV" in practice is very loose. This document outlines a basic data model or infoset for tabular data and metadata about that tabular data. It also contains some non-normative information about a best practice syntax for tabular data, for mapping into that data model, to contribute to the standardisation of CSV syntax by IETF. Various methods of locating metadata are also provided.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <dfn title="tabular data">Tabular data</dfn> is data that is structured into rows, each of which contains information about some thing. Each row contains the same number of fields (although some of these fields may be empty), which provide values of properties of the thing described by the row. In tabular data, fields within the same column provide values for the same property of the thing described by the particular row. This is what differentiates tabular data from other line-oriented formats. 
      </p>
    	<p>
        Tabular data is routinely transferred on the web in a textual format called "CSV", but the definition of "CSV" in practice is very loose. Some people use the term to mean any delimited text file. Others stick more closely to the most standard definition of CSV that there is, [[!RFC4180]]. <a href="#standards" class="sectionRef"></a> describes the various ways in which CSV is defined.

      <h2>Tabular Data Model</h2>
      <p>
        There are different levels of data models for tabular data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>core data model</strong> described in <a href="#core-model" class="sectionRef"></a> defines the core model for a single table of basic data.</li>
        <li>The <strong>annotated data model</strong> described in <a href="#annotated-model" class="sectionRef"></a> defines a model for tables that are annotated with metadata.</li>
        <li>The <strong>grouped data model</strong> described in <a href="#grouped-model" class="sectionRef"></a> defines a model for tables that are related to each other in some way.</li>

        <h3>Annotated Data Model</h3>
        <p>
          An <dfn>annotated table</dfn> is a <a>table</a> that is annotated with additional metadata. The table has a number of <dfn title="property">properties</dfn> which provide additional information about the table as a whole. The <dfn title="value">values</dfn> of these properties may be lists, structured objects, or atomic values. Annotations on a table may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>titles or descriptions of the table</li>
          <li>information about the source or provenance of the data in the table</li>
          <li>links to other tables (eg to indicate tables that include related information)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The <a title="column">columns</a> within an <a>annotated table</a> are all <dfn title="annotated column">annotated columns</dfn>. The annotations on a column provide information about how to interpret the <a title="field">fields</a> in the column.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a name or label for the column</li>
          <li>the expected type of values in that column</li>
          <li>an indication of whether the column contains unique values</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The <a title="row">rows</a> within an <a>annotated table</a> are all <dfn title="annotated row">annotated rows</dfn>. The annotations on a row provide additional metadata about the information held in the row, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the certainty of the information in that row</li>
          <li>information about the source or provenance of the data in that row</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The <a title="field">fields</a> within an <a>annotated row</a> are all <dfn title="annotated field">annotated fields</dfn>. The annotations on a field provide metadata about the value held in the field, particularly when this overrides the information provided for the <a>annotated column</a> and <a>annotated row</a> that the field falls within. Annotations on a field might be:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>notes to aid the interpretation of the value</li>
          <li>type annotations for the value</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="issue">
          <p>
            It might be useful to define annotated regions as follows:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            An <a>annotated table</a> may also contain a number of <dfn title="annotated region">annotated regions</dfn>. Regions are themselves tabular structures comprised of selected <a title="row">rows</a> and <a title="column">columns</a> and the <a title="field">fields</a> within those rows for those columns. Annotated regions are regions that have annotations associated with them. <a title="annotated column">Annotated columns</a> and <a title="annotated row">annotated rows</a> are special types of annotated regions where the region is the entirety of a single column or single row.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            But it's not currently clear that there are use cases or examples that justify it. Input is welcome on this.

        <h3>Grouped Data Model</h3>
        <p>
          A <dfn>group of tables</dfn> comprises a set of <a title="table">tables</a> (which may be <a title="annotated table">annotated tables</a>) and a set of annotations (<a title="property">properties</a> and <a title="value">values</a>) that relate to the set.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Tables can be loosely related to each other simply through annotations; not all tables that are related to each other need to grouped together. Groups of tables are useful because they can be annotated with metadata that applies to all the tables in the group.

    </section>
    <section id="metadata">
      <h2>Locating Metadata</h2>
      <p>
        As described in <a href="#annotated-model" class="sectionRef"></a>, tabular data may have a number of annotations associated with it. Here we describe the different methods that can be used to locate those annotations given a link to a CSV file.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most methods of locating metadata described here, metadata is provided within a separate document. The syntax of this document is not defined here, but these documents can include things like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>metadata about the table, such as titles, descriptions, provenance, and links to other tables</li>
        <li>metadata about columns in the table, such as labels, data types and other constraints, or flags to indicate values in the column are unique</li>
        <li>metadata about rows in the table, such as certainty or provenance</li>
        <li>metadata about values in the table, such as notes or type annotations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When creating a set of annotations from metadata, if the same property is specified in two locations then information closer to the document itself should override information further from the document. Explicitly, the order of preference is:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>metadata embedded within the tabular data file itself, see <a href="#embedded-metadata" class="sectionRef"></a></li>
        <li>metadata in a document linked to from a reference within the tabular data file, see <a href="#embedded-link" class="sectionRef"></a></li>
        <li>metadata within a package that the tabular data file belongs to, see <a href="#package" class="sectionRef"></a></li>
        <li>metadata in a document linked to using a <code>Link</code> header when retrieving the tabular data file, see <a href="#link-header" class="sectionRef"></a></li>
        <li>metadata in a document located through a standard path from the tabular data file, see <a href="#standard-path" class="sectionRef"></a></li>
      </ol>

        <h3>Embedded Metadata</h3>
        <p>
          Metadata may be directly embedded within a CSV file.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          What should the syntax be for embedding metadata within a CSV file? An example approach is shown in <a href="http://jenit.github.io/linked-csv/">Linked CSV</a>. If this is allowed we should specify a new media type for the syntax.

        <h3>Embedded Link</h3>
        <p>

#CSV;metadata=<var>link</var>
          </pre>
          <p>

        <h3>Package</h3>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          What should that package look like? Just a zip? A multipart document? How is the metadata file within it identified? If this is allowed we should specify a new media type for the package.

      <section id="link-header">
        <h3>Link Header</h3>
        <p>
          When retrieving a CSV file via HTTP, the response can include a <code>Link</code> header with <code>rel=describedby</code> that points to a metadata file that describes the CSV file.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          Is <code>rel=describedby</code> the right link relation to use?
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="standard-path">
        <h3>Standard Path</h3>
        <p>
          When retrieving a CSV file via HTTP, the default location for a metadata file that describes that CSV file is set to <code>csv-metadata</code> in the same directory. If this metadata file does not explicitly point to the relevant CSV file then it MUST be ignored.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          Deliberately not included a suffix here, because we haven't decided what format metadata documents should be in, or even if they should be conneg'd. Probably best for the file to be in the same directory as the CSV file, so that you can have one metadata document that describes a lot of them. Should there be a default navigational thing of continuing up the path hierarchy until you find a metadata document?

      <h2>CSV+ Syntax</h2>
      <p>
        There is no standard for CSV, and there are many variants of CSV used on the web today. This section defines a method for outputting tabular data adhering to the core tabular data model described in <a href="#core-model" class="sectionRef"></a> into a standard, CSV-based, syntax. Compliant applications that output this format must meet each of the constraints.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        We are actively working with the IETF to develop a standard for CSV, which is outside the scope of the Working Group. The details here aim to help shape that standard based on our requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section does not seek to describe how applications that <em>input</em> textual tabular data should interpret it, except that any data that is in the format defined here should be understood as defined here.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          This syntax is not compliant with <code>text/csv</code> as defined in [[!RFC4180]]: it permits characters other than ASCII, and it permits line endings other than <code>CRLF</code>. Supporting the full set of Unicode characters by using UTF-8 and supporting <code>LF</code> line endings are important characteristics for data formats that are used internationally and on non-Windows platforms. However, all files that adhere to [[!RFC4180]]'s definition of CSV are compliant CSV+ files.

      <section id="content-type">
        <h3>Content Type</h3>
        <p>
          The appropriate content type for a CSV+ file is <code>text/csv</code>. For example, when a CSV+ file is transmitted via HTTP, the HTTP response MUST include a <code>Content-Type</code> header with the value <code>text/csv</code>:

Content-Type: text/csv

        <h3>Encoding</h3>
        <p>
          CSV+ files SHOULD be encoded using UTF-8. If a CSV+ file is not encoded using UTF-8, the encoding MUST be specified through the <code>charset</code> parameter in the <code>Content-Type</code> header:

        <div class="issue">
          <p>
            RFC4180 defines the default charset as US-ASCII because that was (at the time RFC4180 was written) the default charset for all <code>text/*</code> media types. This has been superseded with RFC6657.
            <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6657#section-3">Section 3 of RFC6657</a> states "new subtypes of the "text" media type SHOULD NOT define a default "charset" value.

          </p>
          <p>
            Do we have a strong reason to specify a default charset? Should we be defining <code>application/csv</code> instead, to avoid doing unrecommended things with a <code>text/*</code> media type.

          The ends of rows in a CSV+ file MUST be either <code>CRLF</code> (<code>U+000D U+000A</code>) or <code>LF</code> (<code>U+000A</code>). Line endings within escaped <a title="field">fields</a> are not normalised.

        <p>
          Values that contain commas, line endings or double quotes MUST be escaped by having the entire value wrapped in double quotes.

      <h2>Parsing Tabular Data</h2>
      <p>
        As described in <a href="#syntax" class="sectionRef"></a>, there may be many formats which an application might interpret into the tabular data model described in <a href="#model" class="sectionRef"></a>, including using different separators or fixed format tables, multiple tables within a single file, or ones that have metadata lines before a table header.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Standardising the parsing of CSV is outside the chartered scope of the Working Group. This non-normative section is intended to help the creators of parsers handle the wide variety of CSV-based formats that they may encounter due to the current lack of standardisation of the format.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section describes an algorithm for parsing formats other than the plain CSV+ format specified in <a href="#syntax" class="sectionRef"></a>. It is impossible to do this in a fully automated manner, so this algorithm depends on the following flags being set externally (eg through user input):

      <h2>Existing Standards</h2>
      <p>
        This appendix outlines various ways in which CSV is defined.
      </p>
      <section id="rfc">
        <h3>RFC 4180</h3>
        <p>
          [[!RFC4180]] defines CSV with the following ABNF grammar:
        </p>
        <pre>
file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]
header = name *(COMMA name)
record = field *(COMMA field)
name = field
field = (escaped / non-escaped)
escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE
non-escaped = *TEXTDATA
COMMA = %x2C
CR = %x0D
DQUOTE =  %x22
LF = %x0A
CRLF = CR LF
TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E
        </pre>
        <p>
          Of particular note here are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The production for <code>TEXTDATA</code> indicates that only non-control ASCII characters are permitted within a CSV file. This restriction is routinely ignored in practice, and is impractical on the international web.</li>
          <li>Lines should be ended with <code>CRLF</code>. This makes it harder to produce CSV files on Unix-based systems where the usual line ending is <code>LF</code>.</li>
          <li>The header line is optional; a <code>header</code> parameter on the media type indicates whether the header is present or not.</li>
          <li>Fields may be escaped by wrapping them in double quotes; any double quotes within the field must be escaped with two double quotes (<code>""</code>).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Excel</h3>
        <p>
          Excel is a common tool for both creating and reading CSV documents, and therefore the CSV that it produces is a de facto standard.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          The following describes the behaviour of Microsoft Excel for Mac 2011 with an English locale. Further testing is needed to see the behaviour of Excel in other situations.

          <h4>Saved CSV</h4>
          <p>
            Excel generates CSV files encoded using Windows-1252 with <code>LF</code> line endings. Characters that cannot be represented within Windows-1252 are replaced by underscores. Only those fields that need escaping (eg because they contain commas or double quotes) are escaped, and double quotes are escaped with two double quotes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dates and numbers are formatted as displayed, which means that formatting can lead to information being lost or becoming inconsistent.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Opened CSV</h4>
          <p>
            When opening CSV files, Excel interprets CSV files saved in UTF-8 as being encoded as Windows-1252 (whether or not a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark"><acronym title="Byte Order Mark">BOM</acronym></a> is present). It correctly deals with double quoted fields, except that it converts line breaks within fields into spaces. It understands <code>CRLF</code> as a line break. It detects dates (formatted as <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>) and formats them in the default date formatting for files.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Imported CSV</h4>
          <p>
            Excel provides more control when importing CSV files into Excel. However, it does not properly understand UTF-8 (with or without BOM). It does however properly understand UTF-16 and can read non-ASCII characters from a UTF-16-encoded file.
          </p>
          <p>
            A particular quirk in the importing of CSV is that if a field contains a line break, the final double quote that escapes the field will be included within it.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Copied Tabular Data</h4>
          <p>
            When tabular data is copied from Excel, it is copied in a tab-delimited format, with <code>LF</code> line breaks.

          <p>
            Downloaded CSV files are encoded in UTF-8, without a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark"><acronym title="Byte Order Mark">BOM</acronym></a>, and with <code>LF</code> line endings. Dates and numbers are formatted as they appear within the spreadsheet.

            CSV files can be imported as UTF-8 (with or without BOM). <code>CRLF</code> line endings are correctly recognised. Dates are reformatted to the default date format on load.

        <h3>CSV Files in the Simple Data Format</h3>
        <p>
          Ths <a href="http://dataprotocols.org/simple-data-format/#csv-files">Simple Data Format</a> places the following restrictions on CSV files:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>As a starting point, CSV files included in a Simple Data Format package must conform to the RFC for CSV (4180 - Common Format and MIME Type for Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files). In addition:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>File names MUST end with <code>.csv</code></li>
            <li>Files MUST be encoded as UTF-8</li>
            <li>
              <p>Files MUST have a single header row. This row MUST be the first row in the
          file.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Terminology: each column in the CSV file is termed a <em>field</em> and
          its <code>name</code> is the string in that column in the header row.</li>
                <li>The <code>name</code> MUST be unique amongst fields and MUST contain at
          least one character</li>
                <li>There are no further restrictions on the form of the <code>name</code> but
          it is RECOMMENDED that it contain only alphanumeric characters
          together with ‚Äú .-_‚Äù</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Rows in the file MUST NOT contain more fields than are in the header row (though they may
          contain less)</li>
            <li>Each file MUST have an entry in the <code>resources</code> array in the <code>datapackage.json</code> file</li>
            <li>The resource metadata MUST include a <code>schema</code> attribute whose value MUST conform to the JSON
          Table Schema</li>
            <li>All fields in the CSV files MUST be described in the <code>schema</code></li>
          </ul>

          <p>CSV files generated by different applications often vary in their syntax, e.g. use of quoting characters, delimiters, etc. To encourage conformance, CSV files in a Simple Data Format SHOULD</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Use ‚Äú,‚Äù as field delimiters</li>
            <li>Use ‚Äúrn‚Äù or ‚Äún‚Äù as line terminators</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If a CSV file does not follow these rules then its specific CSV dialect MUST be documented. The resource 
          hash for the resource in the <code>datapackage.json</code> descriptor MUST:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Include a <code>dialect</code> key that conforms to that described in the <a href="http://dataprotocols.org/csv-dialect/">CSV Dialect Description Format</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Applications processing the CSV file SHOULD read use the <code>dialect</code> of the CSV file to guide parsing.</p>
