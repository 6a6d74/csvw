# prefixes as defined in RDFa 1.1 initial context; only include those actually referenced within the data
# each of the tables are allocated a prefix based on the order that they occur within the table group ...
#    `t1:` for table `Ta` ({ "url": "http://example.org/conf/professions.csv" }) - albeit that output for this table is suppressed
#    `t2:` for table `Tb` ({ "url": "http://example.org/senior-roles.csv" })
#    `t3:` for table `Tc` ({ "url": "http://example.org/junior-roles.csv"})
# >> are these (somewhat arbitrary) prefixes appropriate? ... eitherway, choice of prefixes is implementation dependent ... or must it be standardised for non-JSON-LD-aware JSON applications?

# >> arguably it's the triples themselves that are important - not the syntax or how the output is structured ... conversion document simply needs to talk in terms of "triples"

# minimal mode does not contain any information about the table; only information gleaned from the cells of the table

# note that output for table `Ta` ({ "url": "http://example.org/conf/professions.csv" }) is not included due to table annotation { "suppressOutput": true }
# note that column `Cb5` ({ "name": "reportsTo" }) uses the `aboutUrl` and `valueUrl` to assert the relationship between the given senior post and the post it reports to
# note that cell `Cb2.5` (table `Tb`, row `Rb2`; column `Cb5`, { "name": "reportsTo" }) is `null` (empty) - no triple is generated in the output
# note that the `aboutUrl` property has not been set for cells in table `Tc` ({ "url": "http://example.org/junior-roles.csv"}) - for a given row, all cells where `aboutUrl` has not been specified are assumed to refer to the same subject; this unspecified subject resource is treated as a blank node (identified using a UUID in this case)
# >> is it appropriate to use blank nodes like this?
# note that column `Cc1` ({ "name": "reportsToSenior" }) uses the `aboutUrl` and `valueUrl` to assert the relationship between the given junior post and the senior post it reports to
# note that column `Cc3` ({ "name": "min-pay" }) has been declared as holding integer values ({ "datatype": "integer" }) - the output explicitly declares the data type
# note that column `Cc4` ({ "name": "max-pay" }) has been declared as holding integer values ({ "datatype": "integer" }) - the output explicitly declares the data type
# note that column `Cc6` ({ "name": "number" }) has been declared as holding number values ({ "datatype": "number" }); equivalent to `xsd:double` - the output explicitly declares the data type
