"Chinook is a sample database available for SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, etc. It can be created by running a single SQL script. 
Chinook database is an alternative to the Northwind database, being ideal for demos and testing ORM tools 
targeting single and multiple database servers."

See http://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/releases/view/55681

chinook_tocsv.sh is a quick script that converts the Chinook free sample database
into CSV files. These are stored in csv/ so you shouldn't need the script.
