This attempt is for a single basic metadata file, with no templates, and the outputs that might be generated from it.

### Notes

### Issues

  * It's not clear whether or not the rows in the data block are in a particular order. If so, we'll want to use an array rather than a hash.
  * The comment object is weird -- there's got to be a better way of representing it.
