# prefixes as defined in RDFa 1.1 initial context; only include those actually referenced within the data
# as there is only one table, default prefix `:` is set to the value of the `url` property for that table

# >> arguably it's the triples themselves that are important - not the syntax or how the output is structured ... conversion document simply needs to talk in terms of "triples"

# minimal mode does not contain any information about the table; only information gleaned from the cells of the table

# note that 3 resources are defined for each row within the table; event, location and offer
# note that each column explicitly defines both `aboutUrl` and `propertyUrl` inherited properties for each of its cells
# note that column `C2` ({ "name": "start-date" }) has been declared as holding date-time values, { "datatype": "datetime" } - the output explicitly declares the data type
# note that [virtual] column `C6` ({ "name": "type-event"}) defines the semantic type of the event resource: `schema:MusicEvent`
# note that [virtual] column `C7` ({ "name": "type-place"}) defines the semantic type of the location resource: `schema:Place`  
# note that [virtual] column `C8` ({ "name": "type-offer"}) defines the semantic type of the offer resource: `schema:Offer`  
# note that [virtual] column `C9` ({ "name": "location"}) uses the `aboutUrl` and `valueUrl` to assert the relationship between the event and location resources
# note that [virtual] column `C10` ({ "name": "offer"}) uses the `aboutUrl` and `valueUrl` to assert the relationship between the event and offer resources
