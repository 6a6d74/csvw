      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p> A large percentage of the data published on the Web is tabular data, commonly published as
        comma separated values (CSV) files. CSV files may be of a significant size but they can be
        generated and manipulated easily, and there is a significant body of software available to
        handle them. Indeed, popular spreadsheet applications (Microsoft Excel, iWorkâ€™s Number, or
        OpenOffice.org) as well as numerous other applications can produce and consume these files.
        However, although these tools make conversion to CSV easy, it is resisted by some publishers
        because CSV is a much less rich format that can't express important detail that the
        publishers want to express, such as annotations, the meaning of identifier codes etc. </p>
      <p> Existing formats for tabular data are format-oriented and hard to process (e.g. Excel);
        un-extensible (e.g. CSV/TSV); or they assume the use of particular technologies (e.g. SQL
        dumps). None of these formats allow developers to pull in multiple data sets, manipulate,
        visualize and combine them in flexible ways. Other information relevant to these datasets,
        such as access rights and provenance, is not easy to find. CSV is a very useful and simple
        format, but to unlock the data and make it portable to environments other than the one in
        which it was created, there needs to be a means of encoding and associating relevant
        metadata. </p>
      <p> To address these issues, the CSV on the Web Working Group seeks to provide: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Metadata vocabulary for CSV data</li>
        <li>Access methods for CSV Metadata</li>
        <li>Mapping mechanism to transforming CSV into various Formats (e.g., RDF, JSON, or
          XML)</li>
      </ul>
      <p> In order to determine the scope of and elicit the requirements for this <i>extended</i>
        CSV format (CSV+) a set of use cases have been compiled. Each use case provides a narrative
        describing how a representative user works with tabular data to achieve their goal,
        supported, where possible, with example datasets. The use cases observe existing common
        practice undertaken when working with tabular data, often illustrating shortcomings or
        limitations of existing formats or technologies. It is anticipated that the additional
        metadata provided within the CSV+ format, when coupled with metadata-aware tools, will
        simplify how users work with tabular data. As a result, the use cases seek to identify where
        user effort may be reduced. </p>
      <p> A set of requirements, used to guide the development of the CSV+ specification, have been
        derived from the compiled use cases. </p>
