# minimal mode does not contain any information about the table; only information gleaned from the cells of the table

# in minimal mode JSON output comprises an array of objects `A`
# each row is processed sequentially in turn
# the subject(s) described by each row are determined according to the `aboutUrl` property for each cell in the current row; where `aboutUrl` is undefined, a default subject for the row is used
# for each unique subject (including default subject) in the row:
# i) an object `O` is inserted into array `A`
# ii) each cell referring to the current subject is then processed sequentially in turn according to the order of the columns (e.g. `1` to `n`)
# iii) for each cell referring to the current subject
# iii.a) a name value pair (name `N`, value `V`) is into object `O`
# iii.b) the name `N` is determined from the `propertyUrl`: 
# 			if a default property is used (e.g. the `propertyUrl` is a concatenation of the CSV+ file URL, `#` [unicode-ref] character and the value of 
#			the `name` property from the column associated with the current cell) then only the fragment identifier of the value of `propertyUrl` is used [this is to create 'cleaner' output]
#
#			else the value of `propertyUrl` is used
#
# iii.c) the value `V` is determined according to section [REF] below.

# [dealing with recursive graphs?]

## processing cell values
# if the value of property `datatype` for the cell is `string`, or the property `datatype` has not been set, then the value inserted into the JSON output will be expressed as a `string`
# language tags have no effect on JSON output

# ---

# note that for cells in table `T` ({ "url": "http://example.org/countries.csv"})  the `aboutUrl` property has not been set - therefore each row describes a single subject and only one object is created for each row
