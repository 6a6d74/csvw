# prefixes as defined in RDFa 1.1 initial context; only include those actually referenced within the data
# as there is only one table, default prefix `:` is set to the value of the `url` property for that table

# >> arguably it's the triples themselves that are important - not the syntax or how the output is structured ... conversion document simply needs to talk in terms of "triples"

# minimal mode does not contain any information about the table; only information gleaned from the cells of the table

# note that output for column `C1` ({ "name": "GID" }) is not included due to column annotation { "suppressOutput": true }
# note that a language has been specified ({ "lang": "en" }) for column `C4` ({ "name": "trim_cycle" }) - the appropriate language tag (as defined in [rdf11-concepts]) is included in the output
# note that column `C5` ({ "name": "dbh"}) has been declared as holding integer values ({ "datatype": "integer" }) - the output explicitly declares the data type
# note that column `C6` ({ "name": "inventory_date" }) has been declared as holding date values, { "datatype": "date" } - the output explicitly declares the data type
# note that cells `C1.7` and `C2.7` (rows `R1` and `R2`; column `C7`, { "name": "comments" }) is `null` (empty) - no triple is generated in the output
# note that cell `C3.7` (row `R3`; column `C7`, { "name": "comments" }) contains an unordered sequence of values; the set of values are included as a simple set of triples
# note that column `C8` ({ "name": "protected" }) has been declared as holding boolean values, { "datatype": "boolean" } - the output explictly declares the data type
# note that column `C9` ({ "name": "kml" }) has been declared as holding XML content, { "datatype": "xml" } - no attempt is made to parse the XML, but the data type is explicitly declared
