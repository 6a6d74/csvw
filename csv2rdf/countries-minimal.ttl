# prefixes as defined in RDFa 1.1 initial context; only include those actually referenced within the data
# as there is only one table, default prefix `:` is set to the value of the `url` property for that table

# >> arguably it's the triples themselves that are important - not the syntax or how the output is structured ... conversion document simply needs to talk in terms of "triples"

# minimal mode does not contain any information about the table; only information gleaned from the cells of the table

# note that the `aboutUrl` property has not been set for cells in table `T` ({ "url": "http://example.org/countries.csv"}) - for a given row, all cells where `aboutUrl` has not been specified are assumed to refer to the same subject; this unspecified subject resource is treated as a blank node (identified using a UUID in this case)
# >> is it appropriate to use blank nodes like this?
