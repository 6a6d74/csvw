# note that for cells in table `T` ({ "url": "http://example.org/tree-ops-ext.csv"}) the `aboutUrl` property has been specified
# ... all the cells in a given row refer to the same subject therefore only one object is created for each row
# note that output for column `C1` ({ "name": "GID" }) is not included due to column annotation { "suppressOutput": true }
# note that column `C5` ({ "name": "dbh"}) has been declared as holding integer values ({ "datatype": "integer" }) - the output is expressed as a number
# note that column `C6` ({ "name": "inventory_date" }) has been declared as holding date values, { "datatype": "date" } - the output is expressed as a string because JSON does not natively support date types
# note that cells `C1.7` and `C2.7` (rows `R1` and `R2`; column `C7`, { "name": "comments" }) is `null` (empty) - no output is provided for these cells
# note that cell `C3.7` (row `R3`; column `C7`, { "name": "comments" }) contains an unordered sequence of values; the sequence of values are expressed as an array
# note that column `C8` ({ "name": "protected" }) has been declared as holding boolean values, { "datatype": "boolean" } - the output is expressed as a boolean type
# note that column `C9` ({ "name": "kml" }) has been declared as holding XML content, { "datatype": "xml" } - no attempt is made to parse the XML and the cell value is expressed as a simple string
